# Programming Docker Images - Microcontainers

The purpose of these images is to provide the smallest possible images for
every major programming language. Read more about it in this [Microcontainers blog post](http://www.iron.io/blog/2016/01/microcontainers-tiny-portable-containers.html).

Use the `funcy/LANGUAGE:dev` images for building/vendoring.

Use the `funcy/LANGUAGE` images for running (much smaller than the dev ones).
